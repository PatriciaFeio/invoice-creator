# Invoice Creator

### Overview
The invoice creator is a Scrimba project from The Frontend Developer Career Path (Module 3).
The aim of this project is to build an invoice creator where the user can add available services to a form and generate an invoice with the total amount to be paid. A remove button can also be added to allow the user to remove the selected service. Each service can only be added once, but if a service is removed it can be added again.
